#+TITLE: Class

* Static member
+ due to it isn't member of any instance -> it need to initialize out of class's scope as global variable

#+begin_src C++
class test{
    public:
       test() = default;
       static int x;
};

int test::x = 10;
#+end_src

but we can use this
#+begin_src C++
class test{
    public:
       test() = default;
       static const int x = 10;
       //static constexpr int x = 10;
};

#+end_src
+ aggregate class like define class with specifier is public
  #+begin_src C++
    struct x{
        int a;
        void show();
    }
  #+end_src
